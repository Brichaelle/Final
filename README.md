Summary:
Each year, residents of the United States collectively eat more than 2.8 billion pounds of chocolate. However, not all chocolate bars give the same taste, the same nostalgic feeling or are rated equally. The dataset contains expert ratings of over 1,700 individual chocolate bars, along with information on their regional origin, percentage of cocoa, the variety of chocolate bean used and where the beans were grown.
Flavors of Cacao Rating System:
5= Elite (Transcending beyond the ordinary limits)
4= Premium (Superior flavor development, character and style)
3= Satisfactory (3.0) to praiseworthy (3.75) (well made with special qualities)
2= Disappointing (Passable but contains at least one significant flaw)
1= Unpleasant (mostly unpalatable)
The ratings do not reflect health benefits, social missions, or organic status but does reflect the appreciation of the flavors of the cacao when made into chocolate.
Flavor is the most important component of the Flavors of Cacao ratings. Diversity, balance, intensity, and purity of flavors are all considered. 
Texture has a great impact on the overall experience, and it is also possible for texture related issues to impact flavor. 
Aftermelt is the experience after the chocolate has melted. Higher quality chocolate will linger and be long lasting and enjoyable. Since the aftermelt is the last impression you get from the chocolate, it receives equal importance in the overall rating.
Overall Opinion is really where the ratings reflect a subjective opinion. Ideally it is my evaluation of whether or not the components above worked together and an opinion on the flavor development, character and style. It is also here where each chocolate can usually be summarized by the most prominent impressions that you would remember about each chocolate.
These ratings were compiled by Brady Brelinski, Founding Member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society.
